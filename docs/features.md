# Features

- **Format Conversion**: Convert images between `png`, `jpg`, `gif`, and `webp`.
- **Quality Adjustment**: Set the quality for lossy formats like `jpg` and `webp`.
- **Image Resizing**: Resize images using specific dimensions (e.g., `800x600`) or by a percentage (e.g., `50%`). Aspect ratio is preserved if one dimension is set to `0`.
- **Watermarking**: Apply a watermark image with adjustable opacity.
- **Batch Processing**: Process a single file or an entire directory of images.
- **Concurrency**: Use multiple workers for faster directory processing.
- **Configuration**: Set default flag values using a `config.yaml` file.
