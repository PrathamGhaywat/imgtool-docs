# Configuration

You can set default values for any flag in the `config.yaml` file. The tool looks for this file in the current directory or your home directory.

**Example `config.yaml`:**

```yaml
# Default configuration for imgtool
to: "webp"
quality: 75
watermark: "C:/Users/YourUser/Pictures/watermark.png"
watermark-opacity: 60
